<!--
  custom_ui_manifest.xml
  Purpose: Declare which Panorama layouts/scripts your custom game loads.
  Notes:
  - <scripts> runs early and is good for global JS bootstrapping (e.g., manifest.js).
  - <CustomUIElement type="Hud"> is the in-match HUD overlay.
  - <CustomUIElement type="EndScreen"> shows after the match ends (post-game screen).

    <!-- Global scripts loaded for all custom UI (keep lightweight). -->

        <!-- manifest.js: central place to require/initialize shared JS. -->
        <include src="file://{resources}/scripts/custom_game/manifest.js" />

    <!-- Container for all custom UI elements declared for this addon. -->
    <Panel>
        <!-- In-game HUD (shown during gameplay). -->
        <CustomUIElement

        <!-- Post-game End Screen (shown after the engine resolves a winner).
             Layout and scripts live under layout/custom_game/post_game.xml (and its JS). -->
